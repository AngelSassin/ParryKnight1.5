Known Bugs:



TO DO LIST

X Add all parriable enemies to Enemy List.
X Aspids and False Knight are damageable by nail until Vengeful Spirit (this fixes aspid arena and false knight).
X Account for all charms (yikes).
X Test Nail Arts parries. Do increased damage with nail art parries if possible.
    X Nail Arts CAN'T parry. Just increase soul gain when nail arts.
NO Mod Options in main menu to change difficulty.
- Change Flavor Texts of Charms and Spells
  - Need GET versions of all nail arts and spells.
- Remove orange particles from nail hit, replace with Knight getting white particles to signify earning soul.
- Create an on-screen indicator to tell players to send their ModLog file when an unaccounted parry occurs. 
- BETA TESTING!!!



??? DIFFICULTIES ??? :(
- Parry Apprentice - All enemies are damaged by nail at half damage. Parries do 2.5x nail damage.
- Parry Master - All enemies are not damaged by nail. Parries do 2.0x nail damage. (or less?)
- Parry Sage - All enemies are not damaged by nail. Parries do 1.0x nail damage. (or less?)



List for BETA TESTERS

- test all parries
- test parries that stagger bosses
- test parries before acquisition of vengeful spirit
- check relevant descriptions of charms, nail, nail arts, and spells (when you get them, and also in the menu)
- test all charms. No charm should damage parriable enemies without parrying, nor nonparriable enemies without spells
- alternate routes out of crossroads (no spells route, balder kill without spell, idk)
